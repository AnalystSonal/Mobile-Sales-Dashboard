🌟 Power BI Mobile Sales Dashboard🌟

Situation:
Retail organizations often struggle to analyze vast sales data across multiple dimensions like geography, product models, and customer preferences. Decision-makers need a centralized tool to visualize and extract actionable insights from sales trends, payment patterns, and customer feedback.

Task:
I set out to design an intuitive, interactive Mobile Sales Dashboard in Power BI, aiming to:
1️⃣ Provide comprehensive visibility into sales performance.
2️⃣ Support decision-making by breaking down data by time, geography, brand, and payment methods.
3️⃣ Highlight opportunities for improvement using key metrics like ratings, transactions, and average price.

Action:
✔ Designed a dynamic dashboard consolidating multiple datasets into clear, visual summaries.
✔ Built detailed analytics views for:

Yearly, Quarterly, and Monthly Sales Trends, with comparisons to previous years.
Geographical Insights via a sales map, pinpointing city-level performance.
Payment Method Analysis, showing preferences for UPI, cash, and card payments.
✔ Integrated customer feedback metrics, such as ratings by category (Good, Average, Poor).
✔ Optimized the dashboard for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility on the go.
Result:
🎯 Delivered a Power BI Dashboard that offers:

A consolidated view of ₹769M in sales, broken down by products, cities, and payment methods.
Insights into customer behavior and sales patterns, driving strategic decisions for sales and marketing.
Simplified reporting for stakeholders, enhancing the organization’s ability to identify trends and optimize operations.
